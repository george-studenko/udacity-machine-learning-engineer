    "## Inform the Driving Agent\n",
    "Now that your driving agent is capable of moving around in the environment, your next task is to identify a set of states that are appropriate for modeling the **smartcab** and environment. The main source of state variables are the current inputs at the intersection, but not all may require representation. You may choose to explicitly define states, or use some combination of inputs as an implicit state. At each time step, process the inputs and update the agent's current state using the `self.state` variable. Continue with the simulation deadline enforcement `enforce_deadline` being set to `False`, and observe how your driving agent now reports the change in state as the simulation progresses.\n",

    "### QUESTION\n",
    "*What states have you identified that are appropriate for modeling the **smartcab** and environment? Why do you believe each of these states to be appropriate for this problem?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### ANSWER\n",
    "Naively, we could use all the `inputs` containing information about the light and possible cars and their directions, the next `waypoint`, and also the `deadline` to constitute states. Since `deadline` can take up lots of different values, it would dramatically increase the number of states and thus training time. If we'd like to increase the size of the grid later, we'd even be in a worse situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we could also think of something more complicated like $\\left \\lfloor{log_{3}({deadline})}\\right \\rfloor$. This approach would not only reduce the number of states resulting by changes in `deadline`, but we could also tackle the importance of the remaining time: the state would change more often the smaller the remaining time becomes. Anyway, this is should also be possible by adjusting $\\alpha$, $\\gamma$, and $\\epsilon$ according to the `deadline`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next best thing would be 5 variables with 2 or 4 possible values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $light \\in \\{red, green\\}$\n",
    "- $left \\in \\{None, forward, left, right\\}$\n",
    "- $oncoming \\in \\{None, forward, left, right\\}$\n",
    "- $right \\in \\{None, forward, left, right\\}$\n",
    "- $waypoint \\in \\{None, forward, left, right\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a closer look at the traffic laws given for this project, we can see that `right` doesn't give us important information:\n",
    "- If there's a green light (given that other cars obey the traffic rules), we'd only have to check for oncoming traffic that might cross our path if we're turing left.\n",
    "- If there's a red light and we go left or forward, then we will definitely be punished regardless of other cars.\n",
    "- If there's a red light and we turn right, then only cars from our left would be relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, `right` is redundant and we can stick with `light`, `left`, `oncoming` and `waypoint`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OPTIONAL\n",
    "*How many states in total exist for the **smartcab** in this environment? Does this number seem reasonable given that the goal of Q-Learning is to learn and make informed decisions about each state? Why or why not?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### ANSWER\n",
    "The approach taken using `light`, `left`, `oncoming` and `waypoint` generates $2 \\times 4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 128$ different states possible. This will allow the agent to make good decisions, but it will also learn quite slowly. For Q-Learning, there are many states that have to be visited multiple times in order to learn the value of each action possible. Still, given the 100 trials set for this assignment, it should work quite well. The variable `light` has only to possible values but gives us a lot of indicators for driving well. Combining it with `waypoint` with 4 different values for moving quickly will also give us good directions. They're our \"principal components\" that will do most of the work within the algorithm. For our environment with only three other cars, we could probably even get away with only these using 8 states thus learning quickly, but with more cars the probability of crashes would increase and we'd probably want to avoid these at all costs (at least in Germany which seems to become technophobe judging by the reactions after the resent accient by a Tesla car).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most extreme alternative (besides driving randomly) would probably be to ignore everything but `waypoint`. We'd only have 4 states, and given the small amount of traffic this might even work - but I'd probably not use such a smartcab in real life, and we better don't come across a cop..."

    "\n",
    "With your driving agent being capable of interpreting the input information and having a mapping of environmental states, your next task is to implement the Q-Learning algorithm for your driving agent to choose the best action at each time step, based on the Q-values for the current state and action. Each action taken by the **smartcab** will produce a reward which depends on the state of the environment. The Q-Learning driving agent will need to consider these rewards when updating the Q-values. Once implemented, set the simulation deadline enforcement `enforce_deadline` to `True`. Run the simulation and observe how the **smartcab** moves about the environment in each trial.\n",

    "*What changes do you notice in the agent's behavior when compared to the basic driving agent when random actions were always taken? Why is this behavior occurring?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### ANSWER\n",
    "To me it is not completely clear how $\\alpha$, $\\gamma$ and $\\epsilon$ should be set for this first run, so I simply used `random.random()` to generate random values for each of them. I also had a look at the results before setting `enforce_deadline` to `True`. In most cases, even with these random values the performance increased dramatically. In some cases, the agent wouldn't fail anymore. That was to be expected, because now the agent learns over time and uses the rewards as guidance for his actions instead of driving randomly. Furthermore, the agent violates traffic rules less frequently and moves to the destination quicker. Learning is also accountable for this, because the agent will receive large negative feedback for violating rules and also negative feedback for deviating from the next waypoint suggested by the planner. I also noticed that the agent tended to only fail in eary trials if at all. That's because it takes some time to fill in all the \"Q values\" for a state, but after that's done: boom. We could achieve the same with increasing the number of trials, of course, which would give the algorithm more time for exploring all possible states and computing the utilty for those depending on the action we'd take.\n",

In 100 runs with 100 iterations each, the average success rate was about 80 % - still better than the random approach even though now we have a deadline:\n",

    "*Does your agent get close to finding an optimal policy, i.e. reach the destination in the minimum possible time, and not incur any penalties? How would you describe an optimal policy for this problem?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### ANSWER\n",
    "An optimal policy could be \"safety first\", and I think the agent is pretty close to that. It could need some more training than \"only\" 100 trials, but the states chosen will guarantee that following a \"safety first\" mindset can be achieved. To make sure about that, $\\epsilon$ should be set to 0 either after a certain number of trials or by using a function that converges to 0 instead of a fixed value. This way, there really wouldn't be any random driving after a certain amount of time, but the agent would solely rely on the Q tables / the learnings from the rewards it got.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could argue that the average penalty per cab ride is really small but not zero. However, a closer look at the data tells us that those penalties primarily occur in early trials when the agent is still learning and sometimes later on when he chooses to explore state space by a random move. This could also be prevented by letting $\\epsilon$ converge to zero after a certain amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, one might argue that it is not yet optimal because the number of moves the agent needs still exceed the distance between two intersections, but we must consider red lights that force us to wait or use a detour. In consequence, reaching the target in minimum time is really only possible if there's no red light, so this is hardly possible."
