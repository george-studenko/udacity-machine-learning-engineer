    "We have a pretty small dataset with only 395 rows, and we will have to shrink it even more for creating a test set. In relation to the number of rows, we have quite a lot of features (30). In consequence, we will have to use a classification algorithm that can build a feasible model even given few training items and relatively many features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we could assume that the school might collect data for more students in the future, and this would influence our choice for the algorithm as well. It needs to scale well CPU-wise if we use a parametric model and want to retrain, or memory-wise if we use a non-parametric model. Since there are no hints given in the assignment -- and the board of directors probably wants to see some numbers right now, we won't take this into account too much, but keep it in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classifier 1: Support Vector Machines\n",
    "#### real-world application\n",
    "Support Vector Machines seem to be used frequently in medical settings. For example, they're used to identify breast cancer ([Zheng, B., Yoon, S. W., & Lam, S. S. (2014). Breast cancer diagnosis based on feature extraction using a hybrid of K-means and support vector machine algorithms. Expert Systems with Applications, 41(4), 1476-1482.](http://sci-hub.cc/10.1016/j.eswa.2013.08.044)). In the paper mentioned, SVMs are used in combination with a K-means algorithm. Using a 10-fold cross validation, this approach has 97.38% accuracy when tested on the [Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).\n",
    "SVMs are also used on MRI images to distinguish between Alzheimer’s disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal controls ([Zhang, Y., Wang, S., & Dong, Z. (2014). Classification of Alzheimer disease based on structural magnetic resonance imaging by kernel support vector machine decision tree. Progress In Electromagnetics Research, 144, 171-184.](http://jpier.org/PIER/pier144/16.13121310.pdf)). After all, this approach achieves 80% classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### strengths\n",
    "SVMs can be very effective in in high dimensional spaces. In fact, they can still be effective if the number of features is greater than the number of samples. Also, they can be used for many purposes: we can use the kernel trick to create non-linear decision boundaries in order to capture very complex patterns in the data. (cmp. [sklearn tutorial](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html#svm))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### weaknesses\n",
    "Unfortunately, as we have learned from Sebastian Thrun, SVMs don't perform well on large training data sets because of the rapid growth of computation time. Also, they are prone to overfitting if there's a lot of noise in the data. Finetuning this via different parameters can be tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### justification\n",
    "Using a support vector machine might be a good idea, because we only have a small dataset of a non-critical size. The [API page of sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html#sklearn.svm.SVC) reads \"hard to scale to dataset with more than a couple of 10000 samples\", and we are way below that. Also taking into account the relatively high number of features (compared to the sample size), a SVM might be benefitial. It should be able to create a feasible model given these circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classifier 2: Logistic Regression\n",
    "#### real-world application\n",
    "Logistic regression, despite its name, is a linear model for classification rather than regression (cmp. [sklearn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression)). The algorithm is used in all kinds of domains ([Chatterjee, S., & Hadi, A. S. (2015). Regression analysis by example. John Wiley & Sons.](https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&lr=&id=zyjWBgAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=logistic+regression+example&ots=OYhEeTZMlZ&sig=x14Ux9ZP_gHEKsqmJP-expZFYHc#v=onepage&q=logistic%20regression%20example&f=false)) and can e.g. be used for classifying human actions in videos ([Liu, W., Liu, H., Tao, D., Wang, Y., & Lu, K. (2015). Multiview Hessian regularized logistic regression for action recognition. Signal Processing, 110, 101-107.](http://sci-hub.cc/10.1016/j.sigpro.2014.08.002)). This approach can support automatic tagging of videos, and in consequence improve information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### strengths\n",
    "Logistic regression is a rather simple approach that does not require much computation time, so it can build a model quickly. In consequence, it can be used on large data sets. Furthermore, it is easy to interpret the structure of the model, so you could analyze it to understand the underlying problem better.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### weaknesses\n",
    "The simplicity of the model is also a weakness. Logistic regression assumes that data can be separated by a smooth linear decision boundary. If that assumption is wrong, then the algorithm will not yield good results. Also, logistic regression needs enough data points that cover the sets of features that can explain the target variable. If there are important factors that can influence the result, but only few data points reflect this factor, the explanatory power of the model is reduced (cmp [What are the advantages of logistic regression over decision trees?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-logistic-regression-over-decision-trees)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### justification\n",
    "On first sight, logistic regression might be a weird choice. We don't know if the data can be separated in a linear fashion. On the other hand, linear models can work well in high dimensional spaces depending on the data structure (cmp. [sklearn classifier comparison](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html)). Also, we have a binary classification problem (*student passed* or *student didn't pass*), and logistic regression is pretty good for one of those. That is why I'd like to give it a shot.\n",

    "### Classifier 3: K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "#### real-world application\n",
    "The K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm has already been used e.g. for estimating forest aboveground biomass in Norwegian forests [McRoberts, R. E., Næsset, E., & Gobakken, T. (2015). Optimizing the k-Nearest Neighbors technique for estimating forest aboveground biomass using airborne laser scanning data. Remote Sensing of Environment, 163, 13-22.](http://sci-hub.cc/10.1016/j.rse.2015.02.026)).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### strengths\n",
    "One of the benefits of nearest neighbor classifiers is that it doesn't need real training. This makes it suitable for applications that can or need to update the data frequently as new information is collected. Additionally, nearest neighbor algorithms can handle noise very well, and you don't have to analyze the data for possible patterns beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### weaknesses\n",
    "On the downside, nearest neighbor classifiers don't derive a parametric model but store all the datapoints. This can require lots of memory for large data sets. Furthermore, they are slow when actually predicting a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### justification\n",
    "\"Being a non-parametric method, it is often successful in classification situations where the decision boundary is very irregular.\" ([sklearn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html)). Since we didn't analyze the data beforehand and we don't know, K-Nearest Neighbors might be a good approach. Also, I think it suits the organizational requirements, because you will get new data every now and then that would need re-training the model. Furthermore, you probably won't need predictions on a daily basis, so the lower speed for predictions won't be a problem."

It seems that we were able to increase both F1 scores a little bit - especially the one for testing, but we also increased the variance. We might probably tweak this a little more, but we should be careful not to overfit the model."
