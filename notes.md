# Course notes
## Getting started: From Artificial Intelligence to Machine Learning
* heuristic by *Thrun*: Inteprtet AI as uncertainty management: "What to do, when you don't know what to do"
* heuristic by *Albus*: ""A useful definition of intelligence ... should include both biological and machine embodiments, and these should span an intellectual range from that of an insect to that of an Einstein, from that of a thermostat to that of the most sophisticated computer system that could ever be built."

### Knowledge Based AI
* Deliberation = Reasoning + Learning + Memorizing
* Cognitive System = Metacognition + Deliberation + Reaction
* As in cognitivism, the cognitive system might be a black box that accepts input and returns output

* Engineering AI (build intelligent agents that may or may not resemble a natural equivalent) vs. Cognitive AI (mimic natural intelligence)
* overview using an agent that must navigate a city in http://dilab.gatech.edu/test/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AI-GoelDavies2011-Final.pdf

* Four Schools of AI: optimally vs. like humans + acting vs. thinking => agents that act/think optimally/like humans (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/aima1e/chapter01.pdf)
  * think optimally: machine learning, logic, Google Maps
  * act optimally: airplane autopilot, Roomba
  * act like humans: improvisional robots, Turing test related stuff, C3PO
  * think like humans: semantic web, Siri
  
### Bayes Rule
* posterior = P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) where
  * P(B|A) = likelihood
  * P(A) = prior
  * P(B) = marginal likelihood
* look up: Bayes Networt -> not explained well

### Machine Learning and Data Science
* Data Scientist (Analyst + Statistician + Software Engineering) or as a Venn diagram...
  * Hacking -(Machine Learning)- Math/Statistics
  * Math/Statistics -(Traditional Research)- Substantive Expertise
  * Substantive Expertise -(Danger Zone)- Hacking
