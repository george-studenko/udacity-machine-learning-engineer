# Unsupervised Learning
* Finding patterns in unlabeled data

## Clusters
* K-Means algorithm
  * Define number of clusters and (randomly) choose centers
  * Sort points to centers and compute the "force vectors"
  * Move centers according to "force vectors"
  * Repeat until stable or max iterations exceeded

## More Clusters
* Single Linkage Clustering
  * Define number of clusters k
  * Do n-k steps of building a minimal spanning tree
