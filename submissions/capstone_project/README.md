# Video Game Sales Prediction
This folder contains data used for my machine learning engineer capstone project. I created a regression model that can predict the sales volume of video games based on reviews and other data.

You are going to find the following resources:

- a file called _video_games_sales_combined_report.ipynb_ which is the Jupyter notebook that you can use to recreate my results and also contains my (slightly revised) report explanations
- a file called _report.pdf_ that contains my final report
- a file called _report.md_ that's the same file in markdown format
- a file called _video_games_sales.ipynb_ which is the Jupyter notebook that you can use to recreate my results
- a file called _results_large_grid.csv_ that contains some computations from the Jupyter notebook
- a file called _results_svr_sensitivity.csv_ that contains some computations from the Jupyter notebook
- a folder called _data_ that contains the raw dataset that has been used
- a folder calles _viz_ that stores visualizations that have been created for the report
