# Unsupervised Learning
* Finding patterns in unlabeled data

## Clusters
* K-Means algorithm
  * Define number of clusters and (randomly) choose centers
  * Sort points to centers and compute the "force vectors"
  * Move centers according to "force vectors"
  * Repeat until stable or max iterations exceeded

## More Clusters
* Single Linkage Clustering
  * Define number of clusters k
  * Do n-k steps of building a minimal spanning tree
  * alternative distance measures might be average or median
  * can produce strange clusters
* Soft Clustering
  * propabilistic, two clusters can share a point
  * Maximum Gaussian Likelihood, mean of all points = center
  * Expection / Maximization (EM)
  * won't diverge, but can can stuck
* Properties
  * richness: there is some distance matrix that can produce any desired outcome
  * scale-invariance: scaling the distance with a positive integer doesn't change clustering
  * consistency: shrinking the intra-clustering distance and expanding the inter-clustering distance does not change the clustering
  * There's no clustering algorithm thas has all three properties (Impossibility Theorem)
