# Model Evaluation and Validation

## Intro: Model Evaluation and Validation
* Start with the data!
* statistics and model building/comparison
* "The ultimate goal of Machine Learning is to have data models that can learn and improve over time. In essence machine learning is making inferences on data from previous examples." (cmp. previous course part)

## Prerequisites
* programming experience (check!)
  * especially in Python (just basics - will learn as I go...)
* familiarity with statistics (check, I guess)
* curiosity (double check)
* interest in getting my hands on data related problems (check)
* git experience (check)
