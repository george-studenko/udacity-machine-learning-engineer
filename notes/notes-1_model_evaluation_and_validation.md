# Model Evaluation and Validation

## Intro: Model Evaluation and Validation
* Start with the data!
* statistics and model building/comparison
* "The ultimate goal of Machine Learning is to have data models that can learn and improve over time. In essence machine learning is making inferences on data from previous examples." (cmp. previous course part)

## Prerequisites
* programming experience (check!)
  * especially in Python (just basics - will learn as I go...)
* familiarity with statistics (check, I guess)
* curiosity (double check)
* interest in getting my hands on data related problems (check)
* git experience (check)

## Measures of Central Tendency
* just very basic terms of descriptive statistics: mode, mean, median, ...

## Variability of Data
* range, inter quartile range, outlier = Q_1 - 1.5 * IQR OR Q_3 + 1.5 * IQR, boxplots
* deviation from mean, standard deviation = sqrt(variance) = sqrt(sum(x-x_bar)/n)
* In standard deviation, 68% of the data lie within median+/- standard deviation
* In standard deviation, 95% of the data lie within median+/- 2 times standard deviation
* Bessel's Correction for approximating the standard deviation of the population of a sample: use n-1 for calculating variance and thus standard deviation (s instead of sigma)
