assignments from courses at udacity

## What's this?
I am about to start a nanodegree program at udacity: [Machine Learning Engineer](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). It requires to code in python - have not done much, but I like the language - and I am going to share my code here. Why? I already took the course [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) at Coursera and I like the subject.
